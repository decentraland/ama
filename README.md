# Ask me anything sessions

This repo contains the questions and answers from the weekly technical **Ask me anything** sessions.
The goal of the sessions is to create a simple, efficient, psychologically safe way to submit questions to the technical experts of the Decentraland Foundation while also sharing the learning from other grantees and members of the community and the sessions are hosted by topic:

- Platform: Catalysts and Decentralized Services
- dApps: UG wearables and emotes / Marketplaces / LANDs / DCL Names / Smart Contracts
- Explorer
- SDK (and Kernel)

If you wish to participate in the sessions, just go to the Decentraland [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/417796904760639509/948230185457696820) and check the Events section.
