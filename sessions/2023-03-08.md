# 2023-03-08: dApps - UG wearables and emotes / Marketplaces / LANDs / DCL Names / Smart Contracts

### Questions

1. **Q:** Smart wearables in Decentraland are still in Alpha. Any idea when they will be officially implemented?

   **R:** We donâ€™t have an ETA yet, but it is in the roadmap.

2. **Q:** Will decentraland-dapps library eventually support react 18?

   **R:** Keeping up to date is important for security and compatibility with new features. Nowadays, the Marketplace, Builder, and Account dapps all run with React 17. Upgrading decentraland-dapps to use React 18 would mean that the 3 dapps would need to be upgraded. Unless there is an important reason for the upgrade, a bump to React 18 might not happen soon. Anyone from the community can create a PR with the upgrade for decentraland-dapps, and the team will be more than happy to help with it.

3. **Q**: Any good news about the VR client for Oculus?

   **R**: You can ask for updates in the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/936190478003634176).

4. **Q**: I was implementing wearables mint function using Wearable Shop SDK in Awesome repo, but there's an error returned from the transaction. Any idea how to solve?

   **R**: This issue is being solved by discord.

5. **Q**: will the whale problem be solved? for the uninitiated, most of the DAO's proposals are decided by a handful of people who have millions of VPs.

   **R**: This is a discussion that needs to be handled in the [DAO discord](https://dcl.gg/dao-discord).

6. **Q:** is there any progress on making [rewards.dcl.org](http://rewards.dcl.org/) available for more projects? Can dao granted projects apply to use it for special events?

   **R**: It is something that we aim to have but there are no updates yet.

7. **Q:** Will we be able to incorporate emotes in a deployed scene like we can for wearables?

   **R**: Yes, this is currently possible. You just need to add a character as a .glb containing the animation (as if it were an NPC).
