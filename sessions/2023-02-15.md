# 2023-02-15: SDK

### Questions

1.  Q: Can devs set the default graphics settings to graphics quality low, base resolution match display, ambient occlusion OFF to help reduce lag for new users?

    R: In Genesis City, it's intentionally not possible for a scene to control the player's settings, since a player may be experiencing multiple scenes simultaneously, so no single one should be able to control a global renderer settings of the player. In worlds, that's something that could be explored in the future.
2.  Q: is it possible to publish smart wearables or not yet? when is this going to change?

    R: Currently not possible. There are plans for introducing smart wearables over the next couple of quarters, once a few concerns have been properly addressed. Smart wearables will only be possible to create using SDK7.
3.  Q: Hi, may I know when decentraland will launch mobile client for download??

    R: There are no current plans for a mobile client. It's part of the long-term vision, but not in scope yet.
4.  Q: Would like to know the progress of the VR app and is the intention to make it into the meta store? If so,what changes will need to be made from game?
    
    R: The VR client is being developed by an external team, under a DAO grant. You can learn more about what they're doing and contact the team on the DAO Discord server, where they have a dedicated channel.
5.  Q: What measures will DCL developers take to ensure the platform is builder-friendly, especially for non-technical users?
    
    R: The Decentraland Editor is being developed to make content creation as easy as possible, providing graphical interfaces that will allow for creating interactive scenes without needing to write any code at all. This is a large project that will be released iteratively over time, but the plan is for non-technical creators to also be able to create scenes. In the past AMA we shared a presentation where we went over our initial plans for the Decentraland Editor.
6.  Q: Is there anything the DCL team can do to empower builders to build anything they imagine without overthinking optimization?
    
    R: See answer to question 5.
7.  Q: whats the reason behind the 6 sided bounding boxes? it can make working with odd shaped plots a bit of a pain. is there a vision to change this in the future?
    
    R: Bounding boxes serve to check scene bounds in a much more optimized way. The alternative would be to check the position in every single vertex in the meshes of a model, potentially 100s or 1000s of points in space. Bounding boxes are always 6-sided cubes, which is a lot cheaper to calculate. It has its drawbacks, which we're well aware of, but given how important performance is, there are no plans to change this behavior.
8.  Q: Can DCL default graphic settings be lowered? New users are leaving cuz of lag. Ideal defaults: low quality, match screen resolution, ambient occlusion OFF.
    
    R: See response to question 1.
9.  Q: Have devs seen Hyperfy's amazing drag and drop builder setup? And is that something that can be applied to DCL in the future?
    
    R: Yes, We're well aware of their work and in touch with the team behind DCL-Edit. They are building a very cool alternative tool for content creation. Our vision for a decentralized platform embraces there being multiple creation tools, and allowing people to choose. From our conversations with them, we also plan on focusing on providing different kinds of features to content creators in the future, so there's room for both tools to be complementary with each other.
10.  Q: Is the DCL runtime system and kernel adequately documented so that third parties can begin developing on top of it? Devs have shared with me docs are lacking.
    
     R: There's still plenty of work being done towards that goal. The good news is that there's now someone working fully dedicated to documenting the Decentraland protocol for code contributors, and doing great progress in that front. We will soon see a first version of this protocol documented in the docs site, and also more useful clarifying comments embedded with the code itself. Also there's a protocol squad working on some reference implementations, these aim to be a lot more human-readable than the existing Unity reference implementation of Decentraland that users currently access Decentraland through. These alternative clients are meant to serve a more educational purpose for implementers, and can serve as an example for how to set up a client.
11.  Q: SDK7 - will the DCL app in VS Code have a transforms widget? The HUD extension doesn't pass values anywhere. Creators must copy them down to add to code.
    
     R: Yes, that's part of the design for the next stages of the Decentraland Editor. There will be UI options for adjusting any value in any component, and adjusting these values will directly affect the code that's stored for the scene, there will be no need to then manually alter the code.
12.  Q: Will SDK7 support VRM or Ready Player Me avatars in DCL? Are any efforts being made towards interoperability w/ other metaverse platforms?
     R: We are working on the next iterations of avatars, that will definitely have support for VRM, but not necessarily through the SDK. We will provide more information about this in the next few months. 
13.  Q: how can we reduce the cost of publishing wearables?
    
     R: By creating a [governance](https://governance.decentraland.org/) proposal.
14.  Q: Vroomway would like to test some smart wearables we have made with the team. The smart wearable does not touch the block chain, it's a simple avatar swap.
    
     R: See response to question 2. It's currently not possible to publish smart wearables to the market, but it is possible to create and experiment with them locally.
15.  Q: we would like to help decentraland to develop mobile client how can we ?
    
     R: It's absolutely possible for an external team to take on that challenge, as has been the case with the VR client. You can request for funding via the DAO if you can persuade the community to trust your team to deliver. See the response to question 10 for more details on how there'll soon be more information easily available to help this kind of project.
16.  Q: Why is it so difficult to get linked wearables ?
    
     R: Can you elaborate? 
17.  Q: is it possible to have an nft frame component in sdk7 that supports eth and polygon?
    
     R: Currently the displaying of NFTs on an NFTShape relies on OpenSea's API. Even though OpenSea as a platform can deal with Polygon NFTs, as far as we're aware, this API only exposes information about mainnet NFTs. Once they expose that in their API, it should be quite simple for us to also support NFTs on Polygon, but we're not aware of any progress on their front.
18.  Q: the process to register a DCL name requires a lot of searching and clicks. how can we make the UI easier to navigate? 
    
     R: 100%! We are planning to move DCL name registration to the marketplace. Thanks for the feedback.
19.  Q: The Smart Wearable Blocker in the repository does not work. The Jetpack smart wearable is exploiting games. We've brought this up before and still not working.
    
     R: It's a known issue that we're very much aware of. 
20.  Q: If we have smart wearable concepts that do not touch the block chain can we test them with the team? We have been told yes before but nothing happened.
    
     R:  See response to question 2
21.  Q: Does DCL ever intend to increase any of it's limitations like parcel memory size, and triangle/material counts? And maybe increase the size of a single parcel?
    
     R: It's not in the immediate plans, since making Decentraland run smoothly for more people is a higher priority that goes directly against that, but it's absolutely something that should eventually happen when things are more optimized. Whenever this happens, it should be enabled by the DAO.
22.  Q: How can we boost the loading speed for Worlds? 
    
     R: The explorer team is constantly looking for optimizations in loading times. They have recently made significant progress in the time spent loading dependencies, and there's still more work to do on that front. As a content creator, you can help your scene be lighter by reducing the amount of content that loads on start, for example implementing a lazy loading strategy ( [see example](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/lazy-loading) )
23.  Q: Is there anything the the foundation would like users/community do that we may not already be doing?
    
     R: Help create more examples with SDK7, and migrate more of the existing examples to SDK7, that's a huge help to us. There are also ongoing discussions about an embassador program, where we'll try to find ways to encourage and give tools to people who may want to organize IRL events.
24.  Q: how can we add collider to avtar?
    
     R: In a scene, you can set entities as [children of an avatar](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/entity-positioning/#attach-an-entity-to-an-avatar), with this you could easily attach an invisible entity with a collider, that is always on the position of each player in the scene. This mechanic is only available as creator of a scene for players who are in that scene. 
	 Globally, avatars have no colliders intentionally. This is a design decision, as avatars with colliders could be a problematic experience, or it could even be used in abusive ways, as has been observed in other games in the past.

25.  Q: where would one have to look to find the name registration code ? if they wanted to build it on a separate website like what some companies do with the dcl map 
 
     R: [Here](https://github.com/decentraland/avatars-contract/tree/master/contracts/ens) you can find the smart contracts' code.
26.  Q: What was the SDK Beta release date again?
    
     R: It's scheduled for the first two weeks of March.
27.  Q: can Decentraland add bracelet as category?
     R: There is a DAO proposal to add a slot for hands that is looking promising, and we have done the technical assessment for its feasibility, looking good.
     
28.  Q: Can we ever get animated wearables? Why do they have to be "Smart" to render an animation?
     R: We are considering this very strongly for the next iteration of avatars. This include wearables with extended rigging, spring bones etc. 
     
29.  Q: Can we create Avatars in SDK7 just like the current version?
    
     R: Avatars are not tied to any SDK version. The currently existing avatars will keep working with future versions of the SDK without any modifications. SDK7 will not introduce any changes to avatars either.
1.   Q: what update are you most excited about?
    
     R: Making the Decentraland Editor an accessible no-code tool :)
1.   Q: We will get access to more player controls in SDK7? Such as gravity, player movement speed, ect
    
     R: It's not in the immediate roadmap, but for sure in the list of things we want to enable in the future.
1.   Q: Do DCL devs ever test their builds using less than par computers?
    
     R: Yes, we test builds on a range of hardware, including less powerful computers. It is important for us to ensure that their applications run smoothly and perform well on a variety of devices, not just high-end hardware. We also monitor the performance metrics accross various devices, to help us target optimization effords better.
1.   Q: how can we scale decentraland?
    
     R: This question could be interpreted in many ways. Right now we believe the best way to get Decentraland more user adoption is via having great content. To have lots of great content, anything that can help content creators ramp up: tutorials, libraries, exaples, etc is a massive help. The more creators use the platform, the more of an audience they each bring, and that creates a compounding effect.
1.   Q: would it be possible to have scene instancing be a native sdk7 feature?
    
     R: The person who asked this then clarified that their intention was to have a scene dynamically change size throughout the experience. This is something that may make sense in the context of separate Worlds, it wasn't a valid use case in the context of an open world. It's not currently possible nor on the plans to change the scene size dynamically, the size is considered a static property of the initialization of the scene that is not tracked later in the life-span of the scene. This could eventually be developed, but there are also existing work-arounds to not neeing this. For example, a scene in a World has no size restriction, so it could start out as extremely large, without making use of that extra space till needed. 
	 It was also clarified that for the scenario of a library, that doesn't know the dimensions or shape of the scene where it's being used, there are methods to [query this data](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/scene-metadata/#fetch-metadata-from-scene-code). These methods are read-only, but should suffice for the behavior of the library to adapt to the scene.
