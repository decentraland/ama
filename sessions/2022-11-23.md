# 2022-11-23: SDK


### Questions

Q: When will the latest SDK editor come up, are you aiming at 0 codings developing in the future? If so,  when Beta test?

R: Yes, the Decentraland Editor will enable content creators to build scenes with 0 code. It will also allow creators to write code, it will be a flexible tool that's useful to creators of different skill levels. An alpha of the first version of the Decentraland Editor was launched on the 28th of November, this version focuses on making the experience of developers easier. Whilst it's still necessary to write code, it's no longer necessary to use the command line, and all dev dependencies are installed automatically. It's an important first step, further versions will keep reducing thelearning curve. See the [docs for the new Editor](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/editor/editor-beta-testing-guidelines/)


Q: It’s difficult to invite people to a live event because they are all directed to different realms. Is there a way to fix it?

R: The recommended approach is to include a specific realm as part of the URL. In that way, players are assured to join in that same realm.


Q: The voice chat doesn’t always work for every user: usually when this happens, who can’t speak can’t listen either. Are you going to improve the voice chat?

R: There seems to be a bug that needs fixing in that case. Please report any details you might have about how to reproduce this issue to the explorer team, so they can find a soulution.


Q: Is there a way to grant access to certain areas only to those owning a specific token?

R: Yes, it's possible. Check out this example from the Awesome Repository that does exactly that: https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/dcl-access-library


Q: Are there any plans to finish writing the RFCs? Especially the scene definitions that are marked as TODO.

R: Yes, it's an ongoing initiative, we've started to put a lot more focus on code-contributor facing documentation lately. We still need to catch up with some of that pending writing, but it will get done.


Q: Did you see my comments on working from specs on my blog? Are there any plans to start working that way?

R:


Q: Are there any plans of implementing real time sound synthesis and deeper functionality for audio in SDK besides sample playback? 

R: Not in the short term, it's not in the Foundation's plan right now, but it's absolutely an interesting project. External contribututions regarding this would be welcome.


Q: Can you open Decentraland voice chat for creative use and modification as well ? 

R: Not in the Foundation's current plans, but it should be possible. Player privacy should be taken into account here, surely there should need to be a permission added to the scene's permission. External contribututions regarding this would be welcome.


Q: Can the SDK access the user's microphone independent of the voice chat system? If not, any plans?

R: Not in the Foundation's current plans, but it should be possible. Player privacy should be taken into account here, surely there should need to be a permission added to the scene's permission. External contribututions regarding this would be welcome.


Q: Can SDK extract voice (avatars speak) ? I would like to make a robot using voice chat to communicate with visitors, which requires voice data. 

R: Not in the Foundation's current plans, but it should be possible. Player privacy should be taken into account here, surely there should need to be a permission added to the scene's permission. External contribututions regarding this would be welcome.


Q: Is there a patch note/list that is posted whenever new ecs or other updates occur? 

R: We will keep informing in Discord, in the SDK Announcements, whenever an update is released. Admittedly some minor releases were not announced there, we should be more consistent on that. You can also find this information in the [Github repo](https://github.com/decentraland/js-sdk-toolchain/releases).


Q: Will we ever get access to manipulate player controls such as gravity, avatar scale, and/or custom (not published) animations/emotes for game makers?

R: Yes, that should all be possible in the future. Allowing the player to perform custom animations is part of the roadmap for next quarter.


Q: In SDK 7 will there be a different way to add custom components? How will it differ?

R: Yes, the syntax on SDK7 will have significant changes. This is all fully documented, to be shared with the alpha release of the new SDK. Components are no longer objects, that may have their own functions. Instead, in an approach that is much more in line with Data Oriented Programming, components are only for storing data.


Q: When a new component is developed by a community member is there a process for getting the new component approved?

R:


Q: What is the process for checking in a change when the change spans both the unity renderer and the kernel (and perhaps also the explorer)?

R:


Q: We need to build a multi-land test scene. This was easy before with the kernel test-scenes. Is this still possible? Is it documented somewhere?

R: It's possible by using Workspaces. Workspaces allow you to run a preview of multiple Decentralanad projects at the same time. If these are scenes that are near each other, you should see them renedererd in their corresponding locations, in one single preview session. See [the docs](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/workspaces/)


Q: We have a communication protocol. We think it may belong in the Comms part of the kernel. What is the best way to get up to speed on this part of the kernel?

R:


Q: What would you say to those that claim the foundation needs to train the community on taking the reigns when the foundation decides it's time for them to fly?

R: The Foundation's goal is that the community ends up taking the reigns of the project. There have been a number of initiatives to help promote more contributions from the community and with reducing friction in this process.


Q: My experience tends to get worse than when I started in May.  Why are things getting worse rather than better?  Even in empty realms.    Intel 11 i5 IRIS GPU.  

R: There are many ongoing initiatives with regards to performance, the explorer team is constantly working on optimizing the renderer and everything around the experience of players enterind Decentraland. Improving that further is currently one of the key focuses of the Foundation.


Q: Currently one has to press and keep pressing the T keyboard to talk. Does it exit a shortcut to toggle the state talk/mute without keeping pressing T 

R: It's in fact already possible to toggle the talking by pressing Control + T. Perhaps this needs better UX to be more obvious.


Q: How can I reduce the volume of audio track in a VideoTexture in proportional to the distance between audio source and avatar just like the Voice chat 

R: It's currently not possible, Video Streams sound at a constant volume throughout the scene. You could work around that, though, by creating a system that checks the player's distance away from a point, and adjusts the Video Texture's volume on every frame.


Q: Is SDK planned to support loading 3D models from an URL address  

R:


Q: Agus mentioned that using external content (not in the content layer) is problematic. But isn't that just the same as using an external API?

R:


Q: How can I render a Text / Image onto a 2D surface like UIImage but it is not hidden while the keyboard "U" is pressed

R: That's not possible by design. All UI elements on the screen need to be hideable by pressing "U". This is not just to enable taking screenshots, but also to mitigate any malicious use of the UI.


Q: How can I playback a video on a UIImage. As I know UIShape does not support Video texture.

R: It's not currently possible to play Video textures on UI elements. It will be possible on SDK7.


Q: Will there be code modifications required when upgrading a project from sdk 6 to 7?  

R: Yes, the syntax of the new SDK will have multiple differences. This new syntax is fully documenteda and will be published together with the Alpha release. There will be migration guides and other helpful documents in the future.


Q: Will we be able to add custom playable avatars?

R:


Q: Will sdk7 have an upgrade to the ECMA preferably newer than es2018?

R: Yes. SDK7 includes es2020.


Q: How to avoid animation conflicts?

R: The question referred to a specific scene where a model could potentially run multiple animations, and would occasionally get stuck or not respond to commands. This should need to be debugged looking at the specific scene, as it's clearly a bug. It should not be the expected behavior.


Q: How to add a jump that is slower than the default jump?

R: Today there is no way to tamper with pyisics or the player locomotion. It's something that would be interesting to explore in the future (or we're open to the community doing a PR!). In the meantime, you could fake a slow jump by placing an invisible platform under the player's feet. Perhaps you could do something similar to the [rocket board exaple](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/rocket-board), but where the rocket board is invisible and has more limited throust.


Q: How to change the “steps” sound fx for skating sounds? (wheels rolling)

R: Currently there is no way to alter the player's walking sounds. That's another interesting feature to explore in the future (or we're open to the community doing a PR!). You could at least add a skating sound over the player's default walking sounds, having a system that plays this sound whenever the player is moving, or by triggering this sound whenever the player hits the movement keys.


Q: when we can use the SDK to mint, publish and airdrop items and wearables?

R: As of today, we have limited support to do this, onboarding partners to mint and airdrop wearables belonging to specific collections. We are working on a plan to make it easier to onboard new users and enable them to publish their items through logic in their scenes.


Q: Is it possible to automate the minting of clothes and sell them to the player through the REST API? We make a lot of fashionable items for players.

R: Minting an item is an on-chain action. At the moment, if you want to do it through a REST API, you may need to build your own server hosting a minter private key. We are planning the development to open our own service for others to host and mint their own wearables in a future iteration.


Q: Would it be possible to call to your REST API method from our backend (using on our side the seed phrase of the wallet from which we will mint)?

R: It would be possible, although not implemented yet and we will need to evaluate the scope but it is one of the ideas we have under evaluation.



Q: Will you decouple the new sdk runtime from the browser? that was the main roadblock we had in the 2d client.

R:



Q: How far off is DCL protocol 1.0 with documentation for mass uptake of multiple clients? Very excited by this!

R:


Q: Could you discuss on the progress of portables?

R: We interpret that this question is regarding portable experiences (and smart wearables, which are a kind of portable experience). Those are still in an alpha stage, and their roll out to the community at large is on hold while we focus on the SDK7. They have been used in the past in a couple of major Foundation events (like the Metaverse Music Festival, or the Metaverse Fashion Week), as an easy way to display a event information. However, opening these up to the broader creator community involves a number of considerations about moderation, impersonation, and other risks that we wish to properly mitigate from various angles. The plan is to return to return to this initiative after SDK7 is out, allowing their creation only with SDK7, to prevent certain forms of misuse.


Q: I would like to know how to build a Decentraland.app for mac that points to localhost:3000

R:


Q: I am getting high levels of lag in my scenes - up to 50% hiccups. What is the best way to debug performance issues in the SDK

R: The best way to debug these hiccups is to check the [FPS panel in preview](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/debug-in-preview/#view-scene-stats), dissabling different part of the scene's logic or assets selectively. That should help you find if there's anything in particular that is causing significant impact. See [performance optimization](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/performance-optimization/) for tips on common scenarios. 


Q: Can you let us use cameraTarget without movePlayerTo() please?

R: It's not currently possible to move the camera independently of the avatar, but that is a very requested feature, and one that we wish to prioritize next year.


Q: Are you planning to allow us to use /chagerealm function directly via the SDK?

R: It's not currently part of the plan. There are concearns with how that might lead to a confusing and seemingly broken experience for the player if the scene doesn't handle it with clear feedback. That being said, the difficulty in finding other players in other realms is a problem that needs to be addressed one way or another.


Q: Are there plans/direction to allow us to impact the dynamic skybox of clients directly through the SDK for shading consistency? 

R: Not in the short term, but absolutely a feature we'd like to enable in the future. (PRs are welcome!)


Q: How can I get two .mp4 videos loaded and playing on my scene and the same time? Or click to change? Also where is this recording posted somewhere?

R: That's currently not possible, it's an intentional limitation. It's been identified that having multiple different video textures active at the same time was one of the main things that damages the performance for players. What you can do as a workaround, which several scenes have done, is to segment a single video stream into regions, and map part of that video to different screens. It's ok to have multiple screens showing the same video, or segments of a same video. So with that, you can have the illusion of as many screens as you want!


Q: Will the SDK eventually just contain to DCL contract operations and integrations whilst clients adopt the protocol and define the render finish and mechanics?

R:


Q: What stage are we at for the potential rotation of textures of .gltf files from the BIN files? We can only do this manually atm.

R:


Q: On https://market.decentraland.org/lands if I teleport to a district like Aetheria for example.. I can't teleport to a specific co-ordinate.. Can this be fixed?

R: When teleporting into a scene, you teleport into one of the designated spawn points in the scene. This is to prevent bad experiences like spawning inside a wall, and to prevent parts of a scene that the creator wants to keep restricted from being accessed with no control. If the scene is large, this can sometimes be an inconvenience, as you could spawn far from the intended coordinate. One initiative is to change the behavior of spawn points, so when a scene has multiple spawn points, pick the closest one to the coordinates that were indicated. This still relies on the scene creator adding multiple spawn points, but it's a compromise that makes sense to prevent the other mentioned scenarios.


Q: Have you ever prototyped the syncing of two separate scenes together with CANNON? IE: Can CANNON physics remain consistent over several independent scenes? 

R: 


Q: Are there plans to onboard the solutions provided by genesis.city onto the main map of the Decentraland client?

R: It has been discussed, to include the satelite view into the map in the explorer. It's not a trivial project, but one that would be very interesting.


Q: I sent my url to a friend and it doesn't load for him.. He had a 2019 mac laptop with 32gb ram and a decent AMD graphics card.. Any ideas?

R: Sorry, there are many things that could cause that, it would be necessary to count with more context to find the cause.


Q: The number of Texture in my scene continues increasing even I add and replace the ImageText. Because I didnot call the "garbage collector" explicitly ? 

R: In SDK6, UI elements have their limitations, there is no deleting old elements or images from memory, they can only be made invisible. This limitation is certainly inconvenient for scenes that wish to do more advanced use of the UI. SDK7 completely chagnes the way UIs are defined, and this will no longer be a problem, it will be possible to stop rendering UI elements, and the engine will be smart enough to remove those from memory.


Q: Are you currently collected bug-feedback, and is there any way the DAO can help in increasing the quality of that feedback?

R:


Q: What is the biggest barrier limiting the speed of the platform, and how can the DAO help in improving that. 

R:


Q: How far are we from a mobile client?

R:


Q: Wen new SDK?

R: Alpha release date: 30th of November :D
