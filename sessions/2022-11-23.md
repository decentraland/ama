R:


Q: What is the process for checking in a change when the change spans both the unity renderer and the kernel (and perhaps also the explorer)?

R:


Q: We need to build a multi-land test scene. This was easy before with the kernel test-scenes. Is this still possible? Is it documented somewhere?

R:


Q: We have a communication protocol. We think it may belong in the Comms part of the kernel. What is the best way to get up to speed on this part of the kernel?

R:


Q: Can SDK extract voice (avatars speak) ? I would like to make a robot using voice chat to communicate with visitors, which requires voice data. 

R:


Q: Currently one has to press and keep pressing the T keyboard to talk. Does it exit a shortcut to toggle the state talk/mute without keeping pressing T 

R:


Q: How can I reduce the volume of audio track in a VideoTexture in proportional to the distance between audio source and avatar just like the Voice chat 

R:


Q: Is SDK planned to support loading 3D models from an URL address  

R:


Q: How can I render a Text / Image onto a 2D surface like UIImage but it is not hidden while the keyboard "U" is pressed

R:


Q: How can I playback a video on a UIImage. As I know UIShape does not support Video texture.

R:


Q: Will there be code modifications required when upgrading a project from sdk 6 to 7?  

R:


Q: Will we be able to add custom playable avatars?

Q: when we can use the SDK to mint, publish and airdrop items and wearables?

R:


Q: Would it be possible to call to your REST API method from our backend (using on our side the seed phrase of the wallet from which we will mint)?

R:


Q: Not technical questions but hope you can help. I am researching the Tokenomics and need help. Mod have helped but still lacking info. Dc id: gcrod#7280 üôè

R:


Q: Agus mentioned that using external content (not in the content layer) is problematic. But isn't that just the same as using an external API?

R:


Q: Is it possible to automate the minting of clothes and sell them to the player through the REST API? We make a lot of fashionable items for players.

R:

R:


Q: Could you discuss on the progress of portables?

R:


Q: I would like to know how to build a Decentraland.app for mac that points to localhost:3000

R:


Q: I am getting high levels of lag in my scenes - up to 50% hiccups. What is the best way to debug performance issues in the SDK

R:


Q: Can you let us use cameraTarget without movePlayerTo() please?

R:


Q: Are you planning to allow us to use /chagerealm function directly via the SDK?

R:


Q: Are there plans/direction to allow us to impact the dynamic skybox of clients directly through the SDK for shading consistency? 

R:


Q: How can I get two .mp4 videos loaded and playing on my scene and the same time? Or click to change? Also where is this recording posted somewhere?

R:


Q: Will the SDK eventually just contain to DCL contract operations and integrations whilst clients adopt the protocol and define the render finish and mechanics?

R:


Q: What stage are we at for the potential rotation of textures of .gltf files from the BIN files? We can only do this manually atm.

R:


Q: On https://market.decentraland.org/lands if I teleport to a district like Aetheria for example.. I can't teleport to a specific co-ordinate.. Can this be fixed?

R:


Q: Have you ever prototyped the syncing of two separate scenes together with CANNON? IE: Can CANNON physics remain consistent over several independent scenes? 

R:
