# 2023-01-18: SDK

### Questions


1. **Q:** Some of the updated dependencies stop my scene from functionining properly. Will the latest SDK/dependencies be enforced to users? 

   **R:** The Decentraland Editor will self-update to newer versions of the SDK within a same version family. Existing deployed scenes remain in the version they were published in, and aren't changed. Within a same major release (6.x or 7.x), there should be no breaking changes like that, with the exceptions clarified in the [version support agreement](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/releases/version-agreement/). If that occurs between minor releases of the same family, then that's a bug that should be fixed. 

2. **Q:** Is the online builder supporting SDK7? 

   **R:** The scene Builder tool, found in builder.decentraland.org doesn't and will not support SDK 7. It's a tool that currently supports a very old version of the SDK, there are no plans to update that as it will soon be deprecated.

3. **Q:** Do you plan on deprecating it soon?

   **R:** The plan is to deprecate it by the time we release similar features into the Decentraland Editor, which should happen over this and the next quarter.

4. **Q:** Would it be possible to launch SDK without an internet connection?

   **R:** Currently, running a local preview fetches plenty of information from content servers. Avoiding this is possible for several use cases, but tricky. Allowing the preview to be self sufficient to run with no internet connection has been requested before, it's a nice project for some time in the future, but not currently in the short-term plans.

5. **Q:** Our game notices that the client has significantly more bugs than browser. How can we stop this and isolate issues within the client? Very frustrating
   **R:** Please provide more detailed information in a support ticket, for the explorer team to investigate. You can create a ticket in [the following repository](https://github.com/decentraland/issues). The desktop client should support all the same content as the web browser, and if not the case then there are bugs that need fixing.

7. **Q:** What can the community do to get smart wearables into the economy?  

   **R:** Smart wearables are currently blocked by the development of restricted actions, to prevent them from being abused. From the community side, it would be great to see examples that others can leverage and borrow from. That can already be worked on, even though the wearables aren't publishable in the market just yet. Bare in mind that only smart wearables with SDK 7 will be allowed for publishing, so any examples would have to be built with that version.

8. **Q:** Is it possible to make event hooks or callbacks for when animations are completed?

   **R:** Not currently, it's one of the features on our [feature wishlist](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk/issues/319) that we eventually want to enable, but it's not in the short term plans.

10. **Q:** Nothing in docs for sdk7 and blockchain transactions. Does eth-connect work with sdk7? 

    **R:** 

11. **Q:** This may be outside the scope of just sdkâ€¦any work being done on signing in with polygon so we can execute native L2 txns without relayers?  

    **R:** There are currently no short term plans for implementing this, but it's in investigation by other teams.

12. **Q:** Looks like sdk7 removes most of the functionality required for our in scene analytics library. Will those features be reimplemented before sdk7 leaves alpha? 

    **R:** We'd appreciate more context information about what functionality has been removed specifically to better assess the situation.

13. **Q:** Portable Experience Blocker script has been broken. Plans to reconnect the library so that it works again? Token gates broken into &games exploited by jetpacks 

    **R:** Yes, there's curerntly a known issue with that, which we're able to reproduce. There's a [ticket open to fix this](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk/issues/570), which we hope to resolve soon.

14. **Q:** been experiencing wearables not appearing as equiped on avatar when loading in localhost, they do show up in inventory and can be equiped afterwards 

    **R:** Please provide more detailed information in a support ticket, for the explorer team to investigate. You can create a ticket in [the following repository](https://github.com/decentraland/issues).

15. **Q:** I need to create test worlds with multiple scenes. You mentioned a new technology called Workspaces(?) in last AMA? Can you please provide a link? 

    **R:** You can find out more about workspaces [in the docs here](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/workspaces/). With regards to worlds, keep in mind that each world can only house one scene. Workspaces are useful to preview multiple scenes together locally, which you could then deploy together to Genesis City, but in the case of worlds you'll only be able to deploy each of those scenes to a separate world.

16. **Q:** There is a problem with video ads displayed from the ad server level (based on Adshares protocol). Black screen instead of ads -> views are counting.

    **R:** The issue has been reported [here](https://github.com/decentraland/issues/issues/591)

17. **Q:** ... about ad video banners. The videos are uploaded in mp4 format, 20 mb max size. The videos normally work on other parcels.

    **R:** This information was added to the reported issue, thanks.

18. **Q:** We game makers ever be able to override default animations to customize for game experience? IE: Idle, Walk, Run, Jump, etc 

    **R:** It's one of the features on our [feature wishlist](https://github.com/decentraland/sdk/issues/319) that we eventually want to enable, but it's not in the short term plans. There are sooner plans to allow for triggering custom animations via the scene, but these would not replace the default locomotion animations.

19. **Q:** Will there be a camera orbit operation with a look at target in DCL Edit? It is just a camera local rotation? Also it uses different mouse buttons than in world 

    **R:** DCL Edit is developed as a community project, independently of Decentraland Foundation. Please contact them for feature requests. You can reach them on the [DAO Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/894658869391933540/911098465126342667), they have a dedicated channel there. 

20. **Q:** Who/where can we submit smart wearable concepts to? 

    **R:** Currently there's no specific place dedicated to these kinds of contributions. This question started a discussion that could lead to a new category on the Forum being created precisely for these kinds of topics.

21. **Q:** Will we be able to add metas like metazone in the new builder? So users could add a prepared code from an external place like awesome repository?  

    **R:** It will be possible to have a similar functionality via what we'll call "Constructs". Constructs will include all the data necesary for showing entities or structures of multiple entities, with components to provide specific behaviors.  In parallel, it will be possible to import systems via libraries, and a system could implement certain behaviors on all entities or constructs with certain components.

22. **Q:** Hi team. Avatar shapes stopped working in world with sdk 6; however, they work locally. Any breaking changes? 

    **R:** We forwarded this concern to the explorer team to investigate.

23. **Q:** Is there any plans to integrate a way to have animated textures on non-native shapes? 

    **R:** 

24. **Q:** Any plans for doing Game Jams again?

    **R:** Yes, there will be another game jam organized by the foundation when SDk 7 is released officially. In the meantime, there are other community-orgaized game jams taking place. For example this week there was a pretty big one being held in Nairobi, organized by Metaverse Architects.
