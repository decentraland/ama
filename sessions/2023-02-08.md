### Questions

1. **Q:** Is there anything on Catalyst side that is causing scenes to not load since beginning of New Year ? We had number of issues on varied parcels in Aetheria.
<br/>
   **R:** There is no issue on the Catalyst node, please provide more details on the Help channel so that the team can help troubleshoot what is the problem. 
   
1. **Q:** Whats the number of players supported by a node or realm ? Are there set numbers for each ? Client asked us if DCL can support 1M players ðŸ˜Š whats needed?<br/>
   **R:** The latest benchmark was between 1000 and 1500 concurrent users per node, with the 11 nodes that are part of the Catalyst network there is an approximate capacity of 15000 concurrent users in the platform. The platform has never had that amount of concurrent users and this would represent an exponential growth on the users base. On the other hand, the new comms service based on LiveKit can scale much more so probably a new benchmark is needed to find out where the new network limit would be. In order to scale to those numbers there are several things that can be done but they haven't become a priority due to the current users load, for example, the sync process of the node could be separated from the storage and each could scale individually based on the detected bottlenecks or more nodes could be added to the network but, ideally, each node should scale vertically before growing the network. 
   
1. **Q:** What is the cost of running a node on AWS ? Would you know ? Monthly for example. Would you recommend other providers? What providers are used atm? Thank you! 
<br/>
   **R:** The Foundation nodes run on an AWS t2.xlarge machine that costs about 130 USD per month. Another providers could be used to boost the decentralization so that if AWS goes down, the platform would still work. Digital Ocean could be another option and there are users running their on hardware at home with a good internet connection. 

1. **Q:** Is there a possibility yet for Worlds to be larger than 100MB? There are other services being provided for limits up to 500MB for very reasonable prices.  <br/>
   **R:** The Foundation server offers 100MB, this is with the intention to have light scenes that can be easily loaded by the client as with more weight there is also more bandwidth needed. There are new hosting services created by the community that offered different size restrictions and users may choose to put their content there if it meets their needs. 

1. **Q:** what are you most proud of that you guys have worked since the last AMA? And what you're looking forward to in the next few weeks? <br/>
   **R:** The release of comms based on LiveKit, this was a huge effort and took a lot of time to get there, even in one attempt of releasing it production was broken but now it's stabled, all the nodes are running on LiveKit comms and the performance for data exchange between players and the voice chat improved like 10x. The next big milestone is around Worlds, it is outgrowing what we thought it would be, this started as a preview service to replace Heroku and now it's becoming a tool to bring more content creators to the platform and the fuel to generate the content boom that the platform needs to keep growing.  

1. **Q:** Hello, I am making a tool in unity to visualize Decentral wearables and within my application, is it possible to do this with Catalyst? <br/>
   **R:** Catalyst nodes store all the available wearables and that content is being used by the marketplace to show the wearables and even try them out, so it should be possible to use the content in the catalyst to visualize all Decentraland Wearables. 
   
1. **Q:** You're all fkn beautiful creatures!<br/>
   **R:** thank u! <3

1. **Q:** hello: differences between owning: name.eth vs name.dlc.eth ??? thank you!! <br/>
   **R:** Both types of names are Ethereum Names and the ones under dcl suffix are a Decentraland extension that can have some added value for the platform like using them to link to coordinates, get a World space or set them as your avatar fixed name. 

1. **Q:** what are the incentives to have a catalyst server? any idea on how to have more people replicating our content? <br/>
   **R:** The incentives are being part of the decentralized network and contribute to the community and to the platform, users may ask for a grant to the DAO to cover the cost needed to maintain a node. Given there amount of users that the platform has, there is no need to add more nodes to the network but to foster the decentralize nature of the project, it could be good to replace existing foundation nodes with community owned nodes. Maintaining a node requires some work, patching the node, monitoring, react if something goes wrong, be aware of security and react when something needs to be done.
