# 2022-11-30: Explorer - reference client


### Questions

Q: When will be the desktop client available in other OSs besides Windows?

R: Desktop client is already available for MacOS. It can be downloaded here https://decentraland.org/download/


Q: Thoughts re improving leaderboard by adding a Scene Directory? https://forum.decentraland.org/t/directory-in-game-expansion-of-places-leaderboard-using-poi-data

R: We have plans to include scene categorization, ratings and favorites so the system can determine interesting experiencies for you. This will be at some point in 2023.


Q: Is there a way to upload 3D assets (glb) and refer in the scene dynamically? Ex - render model by api resp(<b>without the need to upload the entire scene</b>)

R: Decentraland scenes can only load 3d models from the Decentraland network of content servers, this is a limitation thatâ€™s in place for several reasons.  One is that by keeping all the files in Decentralandâ€™s content network, itâ€™s possible to ensure the availability of the content long term. Another is that 3d models that are uploaded to the content servers are then optimized by Decentraland, and will be significantly faster to load for web users. Another is that thanks to this, if the community votes to block certain content, itâ€™s possible to do so via an assetâ€™s hash. Another argument is that heavy 3d assets can harm the experience to players, and the system doesnâ€™t know that a model is too heavy till itâ€™s already in memory.


Q: #FreeTheCamera ? I was asking for SDK, but it might be cool for cinematics and pictures as a feature also in explorer, without need to use  forked client

R: Yes, we have plans of implemnenting this funcionality in the Explorer and SDK.


Q: Any feelings about webGPU ?

R: WebGPU is still in active development as a standard, it's implementations by browsers still in flux. 
Current reference client is using Unity as a main game engine, and it makes us depended on them integrating the changes. 
Based on my current knowledge, Unity does not have any plans to integrate the standard in near future.


Q: Do you measure how frequently a scene takes too much time to load?

R: Yes, we have a lot of metrics related to scene loading and performance that we track on every scene.


Q: Is there someone who can assist with understanding more about the deploy data format for updating the avatar's outfit?

R: You can find information on this ADR https://adr.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-57. This documents breaks down the steps and requirements to visualize an Avatar properly


Q: With Emotes V2, will there be the potential for wearables to be submitted that have their own emotes attached (Additional bones?) Cheers!

R: Not for now. The current avatar system and underlying technology is not flexible enough, but we definetly have this in mind for further versions (and more!)


Q: #FreeVertexData for wearables (to use like a tint map for example and maybe even a vertex wind simulation shader?)

R: Definetly a nice feature, we are also considering that for the next interations of Avatars.


Q: Can we have multiple UV channel use on wearables xD

R: Not right now, sorry. Achieving this would require a lot of effort.


Q: Is it possible to make a bootcamp to learn to use SDK? for benninger? The youtube videos help, but it could be better.

R: Yes, we agree this is needed, and itâ€™s in our plans to produce something like that during the coming year.


Q: Can we please have an RGB tint shader/material to add to wearables? So folks can forgo using the hair shader? Maybe an instance material per wearable?

R: We would like to implement masks and textures for wearables at some point during 2023, yes. 


Q: Are there any plans to improve the gameplay and have a smooth experience like web2 games like world of warcraft, fortnite, etc.

R: Yes, we are constantly working on improvements for make the experience more smooth, both from performance and usability side.


Q: Will users be able to change Names in-world through their backpack?

R: Yes! Soon!


Q: Can districts be split up into individual squares so that we can see them better on the maps?

R: Yes! We have a new iteration of the world map that will render scenes inside districts.


Q: When will I be able to visit other metaverse platforms with my avatar's outfits? for example decentraland to sandbox or other platforms.

R: Avatar assembly instructions and assets are open for everybody to integrate it into their metaverses. Its on them!


Q: In the latest iteration of the avatar system, alongside jiggle bones, could we please have a vertex data based 'wind' shader? ðŸ˜„

R: Yes! This is part of the discussion.


Q: Are there any plans to fix castShadows so that if it's set to false it will not cast shadows?

R: Yes, we have that issue tracked and will be worked on soon https://github.com/decentraland/unity-renderer/issues/3533 


Q: Could you discuss the progress on Decentraland's contribution to building the open metaverse standards for building interoperable words?

R: Decentraland's been a constant contributor towards interoperable worlds and open standards. Our vision of "Linked Wearables", our contributions to the [NFT Standard](https://decentraland.org/blog/technology/dars-nfts-and-the-new-erc-721/), and our use of GLTF over propietary formats speak of our commitement towards open standards. Our Catalyst CDN allows the virtual world to exist even if the Foundation or any other company fails. All of our code is [free and open sourced under the Apache License](https://github.com/decentraland).


Q: Will it be possible to set certain display settings either through code or url params? Such as drawDistance, sceneRadius and time of Day?

R: Some of them will be available for Worlds! but most of them related to player preferences will not be available.


Q: Will we be able to get the avatar's rotation? We get the position currently. But to attach a pointer arrow to the avatar doesn't work

R: We have plans to have this implemented in the SDK. Yes.


Q: Any chance we can just get items in-game that are not nfts?

R: Decentraland uses decentralized databases as a way to determine ownership. What would be your approach on this?


Q: Could we make group parties, with a group leader that is able to teleport the players to scenes, So that we could do some tour guides or events like this.

R: We have discussed to have parties, yes. But it has not been prioritized for the moment.
