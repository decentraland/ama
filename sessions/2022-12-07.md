### Questions

Q: Hello, I'm wondering when will the mobile application come? also, will there be extra burn methods for mana supply? also curious about the vr client

R: There is no date yet, but hopefully during 2023 we can see an MVP out there. There are not plans for extra burn methods for MANA supply. Moreover, There is a [Governance proposal](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=1a067940-6f1d-11ed-a69f-9d162c5cc598) to stop burning MANA when buying a Name. About VR, there is a team with a grant working on it.


Q: Will wearables or name rentals be possible in the future?

R: This needs to be analyzed to understand the impact. For now, ther are no plans to implement this feature.


Q: Is there any way to burn estate tokens after they are dissolved?

R: When dissolving an Estate you are just transferring the LANDs inside of it back to you, leaving an Estate that has nothing inside of it. In order to burn the Estate once it is dissolved, The Estates smart contract would have to be upgraded to include that functionality. Smart contract upgrades are a serious business which involve new audits and coordination of the SAB. However, burning Estates would just work for newly dissolved Estates and not already dissolved ones. A good alternative for this would be to prevent dissolved Estates from being transferred. It means that empty Estates won't be able to be sold.


Q: Name swap feature in builder is broken & does not work. This has been going for months now, extremely frustrating. Please fix it.

R: We are still trying to find the cause of why this is happening to your profile. It should be fixed soon.


Q: For Pato, is there any process for investigating user reported platform issues?

R: We are currently working on re-defining the Decentraland Player Support processes. The end goal is to provide an omnichannel to report issues and provide status updates and follow ups with the issues reporters, given the complexity of this effort we are aiming to launch it by the end of 2023 Q1. At the same time we recommend the community to stick to the brand new status page (https://status.decentraland.org) to have visibility on the Decentraland platform health.


Q: Are there any plans for new marketplace features, such as grouping duplicate items under "my assets" and filtering options in listings?

R: Yes! Those are coming in Q1 2023.


Q: Are there any plans for enabling metadata updates to enable image pfps in names nfts?

R: Yes, being able to mint your Avatar pfp as an NFT is an idea being discussed. It’s uncertain if it will also be tied to a NAME, but it might be the case.


Q: How might I, a non-developer, create a wearable-renting smart contract? Is it something that would need to exist outside of the DCL development stack?

R: As a non-developer, it would be hard. The smart contract needs to be coded by someone. About the DCL development stack, yes. It could exist outside or inside. The community is actively developing products for Decentraland.


Q: Is it possible to split the sales on wearables in the marketplace?

R: It’s currently possible to collab on a collection that has different items’ proceeds to go to different beneficiaries, although is not possible to split the proceeds from a single item’s sale to different beneficiaries. That would require an upgrade to the CollectionStore contract and the collections themselves, but it could be doable.


Q: What happens if you are renting land and owner sells it? Does the renting contract is still valid and the new owner can't use the land himself?

R: The land is transferred to the Rentals contract when the rental is accepted and paid by the tenant. So it can’t be sold by the lessor. Once the rental period is over, the lessor can claim back the land (and it will be transferred from the Rentals contract to the lessor). After that point, the lessor could sell the land.


Q: Once you implement the fiat purchase option, will gift cards soon be available too?

R: It will depend on the provider (Transak, Moonpay, Wert, etc). If the choose provider accepts it, then it can be used.


Q: Is there a technical limitation on why the wearables preview in marketplace doesn't look exactly same as in-world (emissive textures look different mostly)?

R: The wearable preview is built on BabylonJS, while the Explorer (what you use in play.decentraland.org) is built on Unity, we tried to make them look as close as possible, but still different engines behave differently.


Q: Are there any plans to fix the video streaming on the client (audio still cuts out)

R: At this point, we don't have any issues raised about video streaming audio being cut out. It would be extremely helpful if you could raise an issue here - https://github.com/decentraland/issues/issues, and give more details about the platform, and repro steps. We are checking the issues regularly and addressing them, so this is the best way to have the issue addressed.


Q: Are there ever conversations about creating multi-sig wallets so groups of people could purchase land/wearables/names? This would decrease the barrier of entry

R: It is possible to use a Safe multisig via wallet connect with the Marketplace where you can buy Decentraland assets. However, it would not work with the Builder or enter the world because they need a transaction to sign the login message. If you are using a multisig where you can just sign a message and support [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271).

Q: Any ideas on how a identity system could be integrated with the DAO, to allow 1 vote per human being?

R: DAO Needed


Q: Could the dApp team create a DAO voting widget that can show the mean, median, and mode for VP amount per wallet?

R: DAO Needed

Q: Are there any plans for L2 names?

R: There is a pending [ENSIP-10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution) to be implemented to have ENS names available in other chains. Once this is implemented, we can see if it is worth it to start minting names in other chains rather than Ethereum.
