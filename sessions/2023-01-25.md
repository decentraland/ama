# 2023-01-25: Explorer - reference client

### Questions

1. **Q:** Our game notices that the client has significantly more bugs than browser. How can we stop this and isolate issues within the client? Very frustrating üòï
    
    **R:** When we are making updates to the client, both platforms are released at the same time. However, there can be platform-specific bugs. If you encounter any new issues please report them here [https://github.com/decentraland/issues/issues](https://github.com/decentraland/issues/issues) or via the Report button in the Explorer directly. We are aware that it‚Äôs not the ideal way. We are right now working with our new Player Support team to streamline the process.
2. **Q:** There is a problem with video ads displayed from the ad server level (based on Adshares protocol). Black screen instead of ads -> views are counting.
    
    **R:** The Decentraland Foundation has no relationship with Adshares. As a side note, the problem of accurately counting display views is also really hard to do, as not even Google has managed to completely fix it.
3. **Q:** Can we include web3auth so that we reduce the friction process while onboarding new users which are familiar with these ways of log in such as gmail connect?
    
    **R** Right now, you can use Fortmatic to achieve the same result ‚Äî but we‚Äôre currently focused on targeting cryptocurrency users (a group of people that keeps increasing in quantity and quality).
4. **Q:** How can I apply for a potential partnership with DCL platform?
    
    **R:** Decentraland is a project run by its community, and as such, there‚Äôs no such thing as a partnership with ‚Äúthe platform‚Äù, but with its community: connect with the Decentraland project through the DAO at [https://governance.decentraland.org/proposals/](https://governance.decentraland.org/proposals/). On the other hand, if you are trying to reach out the Decentraland Foundation, they have a contact form at [https://dcl.gg/partnerships](https://dcl.gg/partnerships).
5. **Q:** Are there any updates on uploading JPGs to our DCL Names?
    
    **R:** We are not considering this at the moment.
6. **Q:** What are some of the new Explorer updates you are most excited about?
    **R:** We‚Äôre very excited about more people using their private worlds, and the surge of activity following the new Passport launch. Upcoming new features like the Social Network are also super exciting.
7. **Q:** Any thoughts on having the ability to do drop portals like in VR chat to more easily have you and your friends jump to a new place?
    
    **R:** We have not discussed it yet. There are some snippets for doing this in the SDK for your scene, but not as a player. Maybe a portable experience?
8. **Q:** Do you have any more updates on the Social Feed and Wall? When is that expected to be launched?
    
    **R:** We have done an exercise with the community to gather opinions about this and people seem to really be interested in explore the social network side of Decentraland. We are currently defining what is the kind of value that we would like to give to players with this, and what would be the end user experience. I hope we can start working on this at some point on the next Q. No release date yet, but I would love to see it deployed second half of this year.
9. **Q:** With the upcoming updates to Loading Screens, is that something the parcel owners will be able to edit and update themselves?
    
    **R:** In order to make the best out of the feature, creators will be able to update them as part of the scene tools.
10. **Q:** When is Emotes V2 going to be launched? So cool that you are planning to do emotes with their own Geometry and Sounds right?
    
    **R:** Yeah! That‚Äôs the idea. Also being able to play sequential emotes, and interactable social emotes. We have the definition of it written already, but we need to prioritize other projects and work on performance first.
11. **Q:** Does the formal addition of 'worlds' require DCL project resources that could be devoted to the client and project?
    
    **R:** We are the same team working in the same client. I would say 90% of what we do in development today applies to both projects, and obviously that other 10% is a short term thing, as we are preparing to launch for version 1.
12. **Q:** What are the 'scene limitations' for 'Worlds' vs genesis?  The worlds release indicates they can be a max of 100 mb; what's total mb limit for 1 genesis parcel?
    
    **R:** You can learn about scene limitations here: [https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/scene-limitations/](https://docs.decentraland.org/creator/development-guide/sdk7/scene-limitations/)
13. **Q:** Have you considered implementing the Farcast protocol?
    
    **R:** Not likely. Farcast creates a name per each user, and we already have our NAME system. If the protocol is open to using any ENS domain name, we could look into implementing it. We are actively looking at all new social network protocols for the Social Network implementation.
14. **Q:** What are the optimal PC/Mac system requirements to access DCL?
    
    **R:** On our website you can find the current requirements for optimal performance [https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/hardware-requirements/](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/hardware-requirements/)
15. **Q:** Will we be able to use markdown to add links within my bio rather than sectioned off at the bottom of the profile/passport?
    
    **R:** Is a nice idea, we will explore it when we develop the new My Profile section.
16. **Q:** When will we need to update scenes to SDK 7?
    
    **R:** We are not going to drop support for older scenes in the next couple of years, however, if you want to benefit from all the performance improvements coming from SDK 7 we definitely recommend to start looking into updating your scenes when the API stabilizes with the Beta release.
17. **Q:** Any plans for Decentraland in other devices, tablets, VR? Thank you.
    
    **R:** We already have team working on VR project, however, at this point we don‚Äôt have anything  planed for other platforms.
18. **Q:** User passport flow improve to 2 steps (accidental clicks block view) first opens Small box on side with basic info and "More info" button to open new full size?
    
    **R:** We have a POC to reduce this kind of accidental clicking.
19. **Q:** Will we have animated textures for avatars or with emotes?
    
    **R:** Probably not in **this** version of the avatar.
20. **Q:** Can you make the "Want to use the Client?" window at load in the browser go away permanently? I never use it.
    
    **R:** Yes, we‚Äôll look into it!
21. **Q:** Could NAMES have WORLD Dev delegates (who can dev/deploy the world on behalf of the NAME owner or themselves)? Could open up an ecosystem similar to Spacesüëç
    
    **R:** We are considering it! This can already be made with the current infrastructure, and it would be a matter of fixing the tooling.
22. **Q:** Are there any plans for creating a referral system?
    
    **R:** Sorry, we don‚Äôt understand the question, a referral system related to what specifically?
23. **Q:** Have you collaborated with Fran Tufro's team on the 2d Retro DCL client?
    
    **R:** We met with them to walk them through the protocol and how it works, but we haven‚Äôt collaborated with them.
24. **Q:** I'm a noob to the Meta Quest 2 headset, are there any plans to optimize DCL for a more complete VR experience?
    
    **R:** Yes, the team responsible for VR implementation is working on that. Also from our side, we are constantly targeting and improving performance that would also impact other clients.
