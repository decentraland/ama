### Questions

1. **Q:** Where would one have to look to find the name registration code ? if they wanted to build it on a separate website like what some companies do with the dcl map

   **R:** I'm not sure what you mean

2. **Q:** How can we boost the loading speed for Worlds? 

   **R:** The best way to ensure a faster loading speed in all of Decentraland is to ensure your assets are all created in an optimized and performant way. Optimize the vertex counts, textures and materials. It all contributes to the total amount of data that must be loaded.

3. **Q**: Does the SDK support customized emotes for avatars on any land or build?

   **R**: Not yet, but we have it in the roadmap for this Q. Developers will be able to add animations to the avatar.

4. **Q**: Is there a possibility that the DCL game engine will be updated at some point? If so, what engines do you have in mind?

   **R**: We have no plans right now for a different engine but there is a DAO proposal who are testing other engines out such as Bevy.

5. **Q**: Who tracks user satisfaction in relation to the desktop and browser clients? If there's no person tracking this, how can you know if they work as intended?

   **R**: We previously had a NPS (net promoter score) that we used to track satisfaction are re-introducing this very soon.

6. **Q:** The Add Friend function in the user passport/profile is broken. It returns an error message. Any idea when it will be functional? 

   **R**: It should now be functional! 

7. **Q:** Is it possible for DCL to make like meta-pocket dimension worlds where avatars/creators can just  jump in and use any game engine they like but completely DCL?

   **R**: This is theoretically possible if you implement a new client in any other engine like Godot or Unreal, but you will need to implement the SDK interpreter, the communications, the wallet integration from scratch. The protocol, the resources and the endpoints are all there to be accessed from any other external application.

8. **Q:** Slow, laggy experience for a new user can cause them to leave DCL & not return. How might the Explorer team optimize performance to avoid this?

   **R**: We are working hard right now on performance as a top priority. We are optimizing the skybox, the way the world streams in its assets, the map, the memory allocations. It will take some time but we are going in the right direction!

9. **Q:** Can DCL remove the download client prompt, newsletter signup, and set defaults to ambient occlusion OFF, low quality, match display? New users are driven away.

   **R**: SSAO should now be disabled by default and we have improved the default configuration options with match display.

10. **Q:** Have devs explored Hyperfy? It's worth seeing. They are doing things perfect in regards to a simple onboarding experience. The lag continues to worsen on DCL.

    **R**: We've seen it! We are working on the latency issues actively in Decentraland.

11. **Q:** Ok, we have seen the explosion in VR headsets. Is anyone working to get the game into VR?

    **R**: Yes, we have working prototype with VR support build via our grant program, and we plan to continue our work to get it fully funcional.

12. **Q:** just like with what's happening to chatgpt & googles Bard...can DCL devs build its own version hyperfy but with steroids and call it DCL pocket worldsðŸ˜Š 

    **R**: I don't understand the question 

13. **Q:**  it will never be possible to have a completely customizable avatar, like with vrm, fbx or rpm files
    A: Never say never!. We are closer to VRM than you think. VRM is not customizable by nature, is just a protocol to transport avatars. We are working on VRM exporter right now.
    **R**: 
14. **Q:**  Can DCL devs build its own version hyperfy but improved and call it "DCL pocket worlds"? where existing users can visit and landowners could build cool stuff
    **R**: Its not our mission to build on top of hyperfy, but you can always ask for a grant. 

15. **Q:**  when I first logged in DCL I had the feeling it was a huge confusing and desolate gallery of dubious NFTs.How do you plan to make it more alive social platform?
    **R**: We have tons of initiatives in the roadmap, including extending social network capabilities, new avatar interaction and gameplay mechanics, better discoverability of content etc.

16. **Q:**  digital identity, will be something about eidas of european union? eidas is a sistem of national digital wallet that it have to exit in netx years
    **R**: Lets see how that project matures and if it makes sense down the road.

17. **Q:**  I would like to know if we can upload jpeg images to our Decentraland names, similar to ENS Names?
   **R**: At this point we don't have this functionality

18. **Q:**   Is it possible to share emotes in builds? For xample, I have a chair object in my build then I want visitors to sit whenever they see a chair object
   **R**: We will be integrating animations in the SDK to be played in the Avatar, so yes, you will be able to do this soon.
