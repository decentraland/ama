# 2022-03-15: Worlds

### Questions

1. **Q:** Is World going to be visible on DCL explore<br/>
   **A**: No for the time being. Foundation will send a poll to include it on places.decentraland.org and events.decentraland.org

1. **Q:** Does the Foundation have control over the content on self-hosted worlds server? Can the Foundation block access to a world content server?<br/>
   **A**: The Foundation does not have control over the content hosted by a third party in a world server. At the moment there is no way to block access to such a server. Eventually, the DAO could have a denylist or allowlist of external World Content Servers and the explorer could honor them.

1. **Q:** Is the foundation the same as a grantee? Can the funds be revoked by the DAO? I think the foundation should offer results such as DAU evolution to keep funding<br/>
   **A**: No is not, the DAO can not revoke or transfer the vesting contract assigned to the Foundation.

1. **Q:** Worlds competes with GC. If you want to build a large-scale exp. you need a large ESTATE. Now that will be free. How is LAND value and GC development protected?<br/>
   **A**: Genesis City LAND still has a unique value proposition, being a traversable experience that gets organic traffic.  Genesis City is the main entry point for users, a “go-back” direction for any world, making it the main lobby of the open metaverse. Lowering the entry barriers for new creators will bring more users and value to GC.

1. **Q:** Can we make it easier for people to nav between worlds / genesis city coords? change realm/go to genesis city is a barrier at times.<br/>
   **A**: Yes, this suggestion will be forwarded to the Explorer team.

1. **Q:** Why didn’t the Worlds update / proposal go through the DAO?<br/>
   **A**: No smart contracts owned by the DAO were modified in the process of the creation of worlds. The Worlds initiative came from the development of an alternative to Heroku, as a testing environment. Foundation decided to publish a beta version of Worlds before opening up the conversation.

1. **Q:** Hey! What’s your plan on number of worlds being deployed and active daily users in 2023 - 2024 ?<br/>
   **A**: At the moment there are 200 worlds and 250 users/week in Foundation’s World Content Server.  Numbers should go up, but it depends on how discoverable World’s are.

1. **Q:** Well-known Genesis Land Owners think that Worlds weren’t discussed with community and they dilute Genesis Land. What you think about it ? How to mitigate it ?<br/>
   **A**: The Foundation is sorry for not opening this topic to the community earlier.  Channels of communication between the Foundation and the Community are being improved with the Manifesto, weekly technical AMAs and quarterly updates. Lowering the entry barriers for creators is in the best interest of the Decentraland project, Genesis City still has a unique value proposition and fundamental part of the vision.

1. **Q:** Lag on DCL Worlds is something that needs to addressed. Even with only 1 or 2 users users it runs slow. What do you have planned to improve World’s performance <br/>
   **A**: The performance of the rendering engine (both worlds and GC) has been improved a lot in the past months. Communication latency has been reduced considerably too.  Efforts to improve performance will continue.

1. **Q:** How will Decentraland protect its reputation and the reputation of Genesis City from bad performance of poorly managed worlds servers?<br/>
   **A**: Bad performance of a scene deployed on a World shouldn’t affect the performance of a scene in Genesis City.

1. **Q:** Deploying DCL Worlds is still a technical challenge, especially for new users, can you please make it eaiser one click deployments?<br/>
   **A**: Yes, that is part of the scope of Worlds V1, integrating it with the web builder and enabling one-click deployments of templates to your NAME.

1. **Q:** Can you share a KPI you are proud of over these past 2 years? What is our main strategy to position ourselves on top of competitors? Do we have a vision?<br/>
   **A**: Decentraland’s Github organization is one of the most active in the space based on [this report](https://finbold.com/top-10-cryptocurrencies-by-github-development-activity-as-of-february-2023/). The Foundation shared the vision of becoming the open-source standard for the metaverse, and how Genesis City and Worlds have an important role to play.

1. **Q:** What is the financial strategy of the foundation to hedge the global economic risks happening right now? Can we get more transparency on the foundation expenses<br/>
   **A**: Diversification of funds, having enough cash to run the operations for a considerable period. The Foundation's financial department won’t be disclosing information about internal operations, not more than is necessary.

1. **Q:** You mention during the presentation that having to deploy WORLDS directly via the builder is in the pipeline. Any estimated time?<br/>
   **A**: No estimated time, but probably in the following Q.

1. **Q:** After launching DCL Worlds and receiving surprised feedback from community members, what lessons about proactive communication did the Foundation learn?<br/>
   **A**: Decentraland Foundation is opening up the space to address questions and doubts, also will actively request community signaling regarding product definitions on Words.
