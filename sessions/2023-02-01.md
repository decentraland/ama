# 2023-02-01: dApps - UG wearables and emotes / Marketplaces / LANDs / DCL Names / Smart Contracts

### Questions

1. **Q:** Is it possible to place a microphone in a scene to receive sound from users? I'm investigating the way an avatar could listen and talk to a user.

   **R:** No, that is not possible yet. The scene has no access to what is happening in comms. The team is currently evaluating the feasibility of it as it has some privacy matters to consider.

2. **Q:** How many on the dcl dev team atm?

   **R:** In the dApps team, we’re nine at the moment.

3. **Q:** Will we have a search feature for land parcels? On the places page or in-world?

   **R:** We are working on improving the land parcel search but there are no plans yet to include places in the marketplace.

4. **Q:** adding a search by user/creator option would be nice

   **R:** We have taken note of this feature idea. Thanks

5. **Q:** Can we add Aetheria deeds to the marketplace?

   **R:** This is not planned at the moment, but we’ll take a look at it.

6. **Q:** The Captcha option you mention, is that in the repository.

   **R:** The captcha functionality is currently implemented in the rewards service, preventing bots from claiming rewards. The server is not public at the moment so If you would like to implement something similar, you’ll have to implement your own for the time being. Several captcha libraries are available for free and can be used.

7. **Q:** Will external ENS names like Example.eth be added to the worlds?

   **R:** There is no plan for that yet.

8. **Q:** Is there an easy way to be able to distribute 1 wearable to a new user that is bot resistant?

   **R:** Same answer as 6. There is no way to do that yet, but the foundation is thinking of ways to achieve it.

9. **Q:** I second AwedJob question but also for selling. It takes many steps putting the price twice and allowing access and then signing again.. any way to simplify?

   **R:** There is no easy way to do batch orders. It will require a new smart contract. The second step price input is to prevent selling items with an undesired price.

10. **Q:** Is there plans to add more open source models to the builder resources?

    **R:** Not for the Scene Builder right now, but this repository is available with cool scenes to choose from. https://studios.decentraland.org/resources

11. **Q:** Some NPM packages are easier to add than others.. Are there any limitations?

    **R:** In SDK6, we have a limitation where any imported libraries need to be packaged using amd. This makes a lot of libraries not compatible with DCL projects.
    In SDK7, however, we have overcome that limitation, and it should now be possible to import any .js or .ts library you want, regardless of how it's packaged. One limitation that will remain in place is that, since Decentraland scenes are sandboxed from the browser, you won't be able to make use of libraries that need to have direct access to the `window` object.

12. **Q:** Could you make it easier to transfer a wearable to another user? Specifically like an allow list airdrop to my existing customers.

    **R:** There are plans to provide a campaign + airdrop tooling open for the community, but it is under research.

13. **Q:** For those of us that are not familiar with what dApps are, please explain what you do

    **R:** We create web applications that interact with smart contracts and those smart contracts. Also, we build and maintain different libraries to build dApps for Decentraland easily.

14. **Q:** Any plans to give LAND owners more VP and/or better limitations? (Instead of giving WORLDs better limitations in general..) (build height, memory storage, etc) (edited)

    **R:** There are no plans for this yet. Please ask about this in the Platform TAMA.

15. **Q:** Is there a way for me to send a link to my "wearables on sale" page, so others will be able to see all the wearables that I am selling at once?

    **R:** here is not a very straightforward way to do it right now, but you could edit https://market.decentraland.org/accounts/0xa9c82036372d4d80ddf74013dd51ebc336092db2?assetType=item&section=wearables&vendor=decentraland&page=1&sortBy=newest&onlyOnSale=true&viewAsGuest=false&onlySmart=false, putting your address in the URL. We’ll be looking into this to offer an easier way to do it without having to edit the URL manually.

16. **Q:** When will the purchase with the fiat option be available?

    **R:** Currently you can top up your wallet in the Marketplace (buy MANA with FIAT). During February 2023, a new feature to buy the NFT directly with debit or credit cards will be launched.

17. **Q:** Can you help with preparing the "Specification" section for the DAO proposal? It requires software engineer skills.

    **R:** We can help you with any proposals that you want to create. Feel free to ask in the #dao or the #help Discord channels, we would gladly help you.

18. **Q:** Will we be able to share our favorites with other players?

    **R:** Yes! The favorites feature will let you build favorite lists that will be shareable with other players.

19. **Q:** How can we, the casual user, best help the developers improve the dApps in Decentraland?

    **R:** You can help us in multiple ways:

    - You could give us your feedback in the #feedback channel in Discord or in the Cany site.
    - You could report any issues you might find in the Marketplace, Builder or Account apps in the #help, #marketplace or #builder-and-3d channels.

20. **Q:** Is it possible to add a plugin for creators to implement WeMeta's analytics tag?

    **R:** There is no plan to do this for the time being. We will pass the requests to the explorer team so they can consider it.

21. **Q:** can you talk a little more about the themed campaigns and what exactly that is?

    **R:** As seen in the Metaverse Music Festival 2022 and the #HolidaySeason campaign back in December 2022, creators can submit collections (Wearables and Emotes) with a special #tag in the Builder. All tagged items appear in a specific section of the Marketplace dedicated to that campaign.

22. **Q:** There used to be an option in the marketplace to switch from Polygon to Ethereum network to find L1 wearables... how do we do that now? Thank you.

    **R:** The filter is still available, it just got moved to another place. You can find it in the new left panel under the “Listings” section.
