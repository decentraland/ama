# 2023-04-13: Explorer

### Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any plans to make the data collected by the explorer (viaÂ Segment.io) open and available to the public?<br/>
   **R:** We're currently in the process of re-evaluating our data fundamentals, which includes our data model's architecture, design, freshness, and alerts. Additionally, we're taking a closer look at our core KPIs such as Users, Active Users, and decluttering suspicious activity. While we can't share segment data just yet, we're committed to moving towards becoming an open data organization in the future
   
1. **Q:** Any roadmap for allowing access to comms layer?<br/>
   **R:** The comms service is open and exposes information about all platform users. It would be interesting to know more about the possible use cases for this to see if there is a new feature or tooling that should be considered for the roadmap.  
   
1. **Q:** Any plans to add flying capability to the explorer? Any plans to add run capability (in addition to current jog)?<br/>
   **R:** Flying or enhanced running may be incorporated in future iterations of the avatar system. While the SDK and smart wearables can enable such animations, incorporating these features as core mechanics in Decentraland Explorer may not happen due to potential disruptions to existing scene designs.
   
1. **Q:** Are there any experimental features or ideas that the community can help build?<br/>
   **R:** Although there is no clear vision for community involvement, a Canny board (https://decentraland.canny.io/) for feature suggestions exists as a connection point. The challenge lies in managing community contributions while ensuring alignment with the project's ambitious vision, product management, and technical design. Developing a robust system for integrating changes is essential, and exploring ways to involve the community remains a priority.
   
1. **Q:** Can you give a brief explanation of the responsibilities of the explorer application?<br/>
   **R:** The Explorer application brings together services, content from catalysts, and processes messages from the SDK. It pulls and executes scene logic, displaying it to the user. Additionally, an Asset Bundle building service optimizes GLBs upon deployment, which may affect scene performance depending on the time of deployment.
   
1. **Q:** Is it possible to run a "headless" version of the unity-renderer that can output it's visual to a data stream?<br/>
   **R:** Currently, running a headless Unity renderer is not feasible.
   
1. **Q:** Have we considered WebGPU / WebXR for the browser client? This would add VR natively and give browser performance equivalent to desktop client.<br/>
   **R:** WebGPU has been considered, but the current engine we use, Unity, does not support it. Thus, it is not included in the roadmap at this time.
   
1. **Q:** Why are people still crashing with the error "exceeded memory" after months of reporting the issue? This is a new issue as of this last quarter.<br/>
   **R:** We're working on improving data management and granular scene loading to address this complex problem, which is a high priority on our roadmap. The culprit is that the WebGL builds for Unity are limited to 2GB or 4GB of RAM memory, and sometimes the assets required to load everything on screen require more memory than that. 
   
1. **Q:** What are the major blocks to having better performance in high traffic areas and large scenes?<br/>
   **R:** A significant challenge lies in the lack of granularity when streaming assets. The team is working on solutions to digest scenes more granularly while maintaining compatibility with user-generated content. Although not a quick fix, it is a high priority on the roadmap.
   
1. **Q:** When can we expect quest system to be available?<br/>
   **R:** Target of Q3.
   
1. **Q:** Who runs the quest server? What are the costs and who will be covering those?<br/>
   **R:** Initially the foundation and the costs are not calculated yet but we assume the same or less than any other service that we already have (we can take the Social Service or Catalysts as examples).
   
1. **Q:** Will there be any analytics or data provided to quest creators?<br/>
   **R:** We do plan to expose some quest metrics like users playing the quest, average time to complete, amount of users that started but abandoned a quest, etc (TBD) to the quest creators.
   
1. **Q:** Why does integrating Worlds to places/events have to go through a DAO proposal?<br/>
   **R:** We made the decision to approach the community through the DAO proposals to maintain strong a connection with the community and landowners. This approach ensures decisions are made collaboratively, as demonstrated by the high voting participation in the last proposal. Currently, negotiations are underway to reach a solution beneficial to all parties involved.
   
1. **Q:** How many genesis scenes are currently deployed and how many world scenes are currently deployed?<br/>
   **R:** There are 16,006 deployed Scenes, and 234 Worlds. See  https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-monitor/
   
1. **Q:** Will there be a toggle for WORLDs on profile? Toggle on if content deployed. If toggled on, other users see a clickable link to it on my profile<br/>
   **R:** This is a good idea which we will think about.
   
1. **Q:** Has there been any progress towards the approach for white labelling the explorer for Worlds implementations?<br/>
   **R:** White labelling the Worlds implementation is not currently planned.
   
1. **Q:** Do SDK6 scenes work unaltered in SDK7? If not, how much rewriting does the typical scene require?<br/>
   **R:** SDK7 has very different syntax, the differences go beyond arbitrary name changes, they are product of some deep architectural and conceptual modifications. The code of a scene written for SDK6 will require significant modification to run in SDK7. We recommend looking at SDK7 example scenes here: https://studios.decentraland.org/resources
   
1. **Q:** Will you be able to "teleportTo" a world via SDK?<br/>
   **R:** Yes, it will. Currently the function ChangeRealm()  exists which can do this, though itâ€™s not documented yet as it will require displaying a UI confirmation prompt to be fully implemented.
   
1. **Q:** When Smart Wearables will be introduced publicly ? ðŸ¤—<br/>
   **R:** This is a complex project as it involves many changes in most systems and the definition of clear rules to be secure. The target is by the end of Q3.
   
1. **Q:** Will you provide a link to the marketplace name in the profile dashboard if the name is already taken?<br/>
   **R:** This is a good idea which we will think about.
   
1. **Q:** I would like to see a feature where pictures & logos can be uploaded to DCL Names. Similar to ENS domains. Do you have any plans for this feature?<br/>
   **R:** Thanks for the idea, we will consider it. We are always working on adding more customization options for the profile to enhance self expression and make them more interesting.
   
1. **Q:** When can we expect to see the name swap feature inside explorer?<br/>
   **R:** We have it on the roadmap for Q2, but could be early/mid Q3 in the worst case.
