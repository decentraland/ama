# 2023-02-15: SDK

### Questions

1.  Q: Can devs set the default graphics settings to graphics quality low, base resolution match display, ambient occlusion OFF to help reduce lag for new users?

    R: In Genesis City, it's intentionally not possible for a scene to control the player's settings, since a player may be experiencing multiple scenes simultaneously, so no single one should be able to control that. In worlds, that's something that could be explored in the future.
2.  Q: is it possible to publish smart wearables or not yet? when is this going to change?

    R: Currently not possible. There are plans for introducing smart wearables over the next couple of quarters, once a few concerns have been properly addressed. Smart wearables will only be possible to create using SDK7.
3.  Q: Hi, may I know when decentrland will launch mobile client for download??

    R: There are no current plans for a mobile client. It's part of the long-term vision, but not in scope yet.
4.  Q: Would like to know the progress of the VR app and is the intention to make it into the meta store? If so,what changes will need to be made from game?
    
    R: The VR client is being developed by an external team, under a DAO grant. You can learn more about what they're doing and contact the team on the DAO Discord server, where they have a dedicated channel.
5.  Q: What measures will DCL developers take to ensure the platform is builder-friendly, especially for non-technical users?
    
    R: The Decentraland Editor is being developed to make content creation as easy as possible, providing graphical interfaces that will allow for creating interactive scenes without needing to write any code at all. This is a large project that will be released iteratively over time, but the plan is for non-technical creators to also be able to create scenes. In the past AMA we shared a presentation where we went over our initial plans for the Decentraland Editor.
6.  Q: Is there anything the DCL team can do to empower builders to build anything they imagine without overthinking optimization?
    
    R: See answer to question 5.
7.  Q: whats the reason behind the 6 sided bounding boxes? it can make working with odd shaped plots a bit of a pain. is there a vision to change this in the future?
    
    R: Bounding boxes serve to check scene bounds in a much more optimized way. The alternative would be to check the position in every single vertex in the meshes of a model, potentially 100s or 1000s of points in space. Bounding boxes are always 6-sided cubes, which is a lot cheaper to calculate. It has its drawbacks, which we're well aware of, but given how important performance is, there are no plans to change this behavior.
8.  Q: Can DCL default graphic settings be lowered? New users are leaving cuz of lag. Ideal defaults: low quality, match screen resolution, ambient occlusion OFF.
    
    R: See response to question 1.
9.  Q: Have devs seen Hyperfy's amazing drag and drop builder setup? And is that something that can be applied to DCL in the future?
    
    R: Yes, We're well aware of their work and in touch with the team behind DCL-Edit. They are building a very cool alternative tool for content creation. Our vision for a decentralized platform embraces there being multiple creation tools, and allowing people to choose. From our conversations with them, we also plan on focusing on providing different kinds of features to content creators in the future, so there's room for both tools to be complementary with each other.
10.  Q: Is the DCL runtime system and kernel adequately documented so that third parties can begin developing on top of it? Devs have shared with me docs are lacking.
    
    R: There's still plenty of work being done towards that goal. The good news is that there's now someone working fully dedicated to documenting the Decentraland protocol for code contributors, and doing great progress in that front. We will soon see a first version of this protocol documented in the docs site. Also there's a protocol squad working on some reference implementations, which aim to be a lot more human-readable. The Unity reference implementation of Decentraaland that users currently access Decentraland with may be harder to read as code, as it's undergone many adjustments and optimizations over time, these alternative clients are meant to serve more of an educational purpose for implementers, and can serve as an example.
11.  Q: SDK7 - will the DCL app in VS Code have a transforms widget? The HUD extension doesn't pass values anywhere. Creators must copy them down to add to code.
    
    R:
12.  Q: Will SDK7 support VRM or Ready Player Me avatars in DCL? Are any efforts being made towards interoperability w/ other metaverse platforms?
    
    R:
13.  Q: how can we reduce the cost of publishing wearables?
    
    R:
14.  Q: Vroomway would like to test some smart wearables we have made with the team. The smart wearable does not touch the block chain, it's a simple avatar swap.
    
    R: See response to question 2
15.  Q: we would like to help decentraland to develop mobile client how can we ?
    
    R: 
16.  Q: Why is it so difficult to get linked wearables ?
    
    R:
17.  Q: is it possible to have an nft frame component in sdk7 that supports eth and polygon?
    
    R:
18.  Q: the process to register a DCL name requires a lot of searching and clicks. how can we make the UI easier to navigate? 
    
    R:
19.  Q: The Smart Wearable Blocker in the repository does not work. The Jetpack smart wearable is exploiting games. We've brought this up before and still not working.
    
    R:
20.  Q: If we have smart wearable concepts that do not touch the block chain can we test them with the team? We have been told yes before but nothing happened.
    
    R:  See response to question 2
21.  Q: Does DCL ever intend to increase any of it's limitations like parcel memory size, and triangle/material counts? And maybe increase the size of a single parcel?
    
    R:
22.  Q: How can we boost the loading speed for Worlds? 
    
    R:
23.  Q: Is there anything the the foundation would like users/community do that we may not already be doing?
    
    R:
24.  Q: how can we add collider to avtar?
    
    R:

25.  Q: where would one have to look to find the name registration code ? if they wanted to build it on a separate website like what some companies do with the dcl map 
 
    R:
26.  Q: What was the SDK Beta release date again?
    
    R: It's scheduled for the first two weeks of March.
27.  Q: can decentraland add bracelet as category?
    
    R:
28.  Q: Can we ever get animated wearables? Why do they have to be "Smart" to render an animation?
    
    R:
29.  Q: Can we create Avatars in SDK7 just like the current version?
    
    R:
1.  Q: what update are you most excited about?
    
    R:
1.  Q: We will get access to more player controls in SDK7? Such as gravity, player movement speed, ect
    
    R:
1.  Q: Do DCL devs ever test their builds using less than par computers?
    
    R:
1.  Q: how can we scale decentraland?
    
    R:
1.  Q: would it be possible to have scene instancing be a native sdk7 feature?
    
    R:
