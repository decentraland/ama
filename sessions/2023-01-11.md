### Questions

1. **Q:** Can we create a new catalyst that is a different city to Genesis city with its own landsale? <br/>
   **R:** That would be Decentraland fork and yes all the tools are there to do it, there are several projects out there that are already doing this. You would need to create new LAND contracts and have your Catalyst running the validations with those contracts.  

1. **Q:**  Why did you deprecate historical data on the catalyst node; deployments / pointer data is no longer accessible. Can you explain how to deploy an archival node? <br/> **R:** Historical data in the Catalysts hasn't been deprecated, if the Content Server has the Garbage Collection disabled then no entity is ever deleted.
Anyway, there is an endpoint to access the historical data that has been deprecated: `/content/deployments` the reason behind that decision is that before Catalyst v3 (https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst/releases/tag/3.0.0) that endpoint was needed to sync servers, after that release the endpoints used are: `/content/snapshot` and `/content/pointer-changes`. As there wasn't any known use case for that endpoint, and the cost of querying the database to retrieve the data was expensive, then the decision was to rate limit that endpoint to 3 requests for minute and use it for debugging purposes only.
In the same direction, there was a refactor of the tables used by the database (https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst/issues/1112) where `last_deployed_pointers` and `pointer_history` tables were removed without any data lost. They were massive tables, expensive to store. Also they made deploying new entities run a lot of time-consuming queries. The information that was used out of them was mainly for figuring out land overwrites during scene deployments. That was replaced by a simpler query on deployments table that doesn't need to maintain all the history and is more performant.
 
Decentraland foundation hosts a peer-historical.decentraland.org catalyst which stores all the historical scenes and wearables. To setup a node like that, you can run it in `READ_ONLY=true` mode (configure it in the `.env` file) and make it listen the PROD DAO of the Catalysts so all new changes will be synced and stored locally. 


1. **Q:** Do you believe it's a conflict of interest for the Foundation to subsidize node operators directly - why or why not? Do you think this practice should continue? <br/>
   **R:** To kick off Decentraland, some parties agreed to kick off the first nodes and depending on the case some rewards agreements were created to cover the cost of running the nodes. So far there has been no issues with this model even if the foundation provides these rewards but if there is any different idea or you think it would be better for the DAO to pay for these rewards you can submit a proposal for that. It would be beneficial for the community to host more Catalyst nodes.  


1. **Q:** Would you be willing to publish (e.g. to GitHub) the contractual agreement you have in place between the Foundation and Node Operators? <br/>
   **R:** There might be legal implications of publishing a contract with private parties, this can not be done without lawyers approval. If you'd like to host a node you can submit a DAO proposal and also add a clause to have a public contract and lead by example. 

1. **Q:** What are the server requirements by x quantity of users for the catalyst servers? Thanks <br/>
   **R:** The foundation Catalyst nodes are running on an AWS t2.xlarge machine, it has 4 cores, 16GiB, and it is required to have at least 1TB of disk space, these instances are able to host between 1000 to 1500 concurrent users. Now, for the communication services we are starting to use a LiveKit Cluster, a single node with similar HW requirements can manage around 300 to 400 users with high-speed comms. 


1. **Q:** How many worlds have been deployed? Can I check that information by consulting the content server? <br/>
   **R:** As of today, there are 110 Worlds. The Catalyst monitor exposes this information: https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-monitor/ 

1. **Q:** How can I check the traffic/visitors of a World? <br/>
   **R:** The catalyst monitor exposes how many users are in World scenes https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-monitor/. What you cannot see for the time being is in which world, in the future this information will also be exposed through the Places site: https://places.decentraland.org/


1. **Q:** How can I learn more about the format of the data to update the avatar's outfit? <br/>
   **R:** All the entities formats and schemas are published here https://github.com/decentraland/common-schemas 


1. **Q:** Will there ever be a way to purchase more parcels/MB for scenes deployed to Worlds? To get above the current 100MB 2x2 limitation <br/>
   **R:** To kick-off the product and see how it grows a conservative limit was needed, not the product team is thinking of ways to expand the scene size limits in order to be more flexible. 

1. **Q:** will worlds servers have stats accessible in the same way current catalysts have stats available? <br/>
   **R:** The current stats shown at the Catalyst Monitor are already accessible through APIs https://worlds-content-server.decentraland.org/status and https://ws-room-service.decentraland.org/status

1. **Q:** What is involved with adding a new wearable category? Currently Hands category is in stag 2/3 in the voting system in the DAO. How can people contribute to help<br/>
   **R:** From the Content Server point of view, it is only a field to support the new category https://github.com/decentraland/common-schemas/blob/main/src/dapps/wearable-category.ts 


1. **Q:** Would it be possible to select multiple names when deploying to increase the number of parcels in a single deployment? <br/>
   **R:** For the time being this is not part of the road map but the product team is thinking of ways to expand the scene size limits. 

1. **Q:** Any plans to launch an npm package so that users can launch a WSS connection with one click? Currently the process is a bit long. <br/>
   **R:** The Foundation services make use of the Well known component HTTP server https://github.com/well-known-components/http-server/blob/main/src/server.ts and the Component for Web Sockets: 
   https://github.com/decentraland/ws-room-service/blob/main/src/components.ts#L26-L27 
   This may help with any WS implementation and it's all Open Source under the Well Knonw Components organization.


1. **Q:** If we are improving search functions for Worlds, what is the plan to improve search functions in DCL?  <br/>
   **R:** Worlds search and index would be the same as for scenes on the Genesis City and that is through the places site: https://places.decentraland.org/ - Next version of worlds will expose information to be consumed and published by Places.

1. **Q:** Any plans to redesign the districts that have now dissolved? <br/>
   **R:** Districts are managed by the owners, any district dissolution or redesign belongs to the LAND owners of the district. 

1. **Q:** Can we get all the chats on the discord in-game?<br/>
   **R:** This is an integration that might be possible, provided Discord's API availability for us to consume the chats in-world. We have many upcoming plans to improve the chat, adding new features to our own service, however this integration specifically is not something we are currently prioritizing.

1. **Q:** Can we have public name channel chats like chat.dcl.eth? So people can publicly talk about a specific project on dcl? <br/>
   **R:** As of November 2022, we released the public channels for the in-world chat with a limited number of them for public use. Since then, we have onboarded many communities and created channels to discuss relevant topics to each, if this is the use case, please contact a moderator in the community. In the future we are also planning to have private channels for individuals to manage on their own.


1. **Q:** How can I chat with my Decentraland friends without using the reference client? Can I use an alternative chat application or build one? <br/>
   **R:** We currently develop and maintain [an open source client](https://github.com/decentraland/matrix-client) to connect to the chat and friends service which would be helpful to build something of the kind.

1. **Q:** How can I query the list of friends of an address? <br/>
   **R:** There is a development going on that will enable clients to query friends and mutual friends. The new Social Service is expected to go live in January 2023, we will keep everyone posted.



The following questions will be copied for the next AMA session under the SDK topic: 

- Portable Experience Blocker script has been broken. Plans to reconnect the library so that it works again? Token gates broken into &games exploited by jetpacks
- Some of the updated dependencies stop my scene from functionining properly. Will the latest SDK/dependencies be enforced to users?
- Is the online builder supporting SDK7? Do you plan on deprecating it soon? 
- Would it be possible to launch SDK without an internet connection?
- been experiencing wearables not appearing as equiped on avatar when loading in localhost, they do show up in inventory and can be equiped afterwards
