### Questions


1. **Q:** From the catalyst team's perspective, what is a good direction for dcl-metrics? what is something that is not in your roadmap but you would see as useful?<br/>
   **R:** Most data that catalyst expose is being consumed and graphed by DCL Metrics in a very nice way, DCL Metrics could evolve by starting to cross existing profile information with blockchain or marketplace information data. Users Wallet could be categorized in different tiers based on the economy they generate, a ranking could be created for wallets with more wearables, lands, MANA, users that publish more content and how frequent and a list of the most engaged users in the platform.


1. **Q:** Any plans on changing /changerealm X.dcl.eth to >> /worlds X ? <br/>
   **R:** This is already possible by doing `/world name.dcl.eth` and the command information is available by executing the `/help` command. 


1. **Q:** Where can I find documentation about authenticating/interacting with the communication services to build an app that lets me chat with my friends?<br/>
   **R:** There currently is an open source client available that is used by the Explorer and could be used in your application. [The implementation can be found here](https://github.com/decentraland/matrix-client). However, note that a rework of different parts of the friends and private messaging system is undergoing and the friend management and potentially the presence feature will be moved to a new solution. Will keep you posted!

   **R:** Yes, see the response above.
