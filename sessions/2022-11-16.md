### Questions 

1. **Q:** Is there a way that community members can help improve the performance of the Catalyst servers? Perhaps by spinning up their own IPFS nodes to host glb assets?<br/>
**R:** To help improve the performance of the catalysts you can start up a Catalyst Node and run profiling, send pull requests or [open issues](https://github.com/decentraland/issues/issues/new/choose)/discussiones at Github if you find improvements. Also, if you find a bug you can report it to the [Catalyst Repository](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst) with a step by step guide to reproduce it.

1. **Q:** Would it be possible to include the `scene_cid` in comms/x output? or create a webhook that fires when a new scene is deployed?<br/>
**R:** It’s not the responsibility of comms to know which is the scene_id, that’s Content Server’s responsibility. You could leverage the [snapshots-fetcher repository](https://github.com/decentraland/snapshots-fetcher), as it’s done in [deployments-to-sqs](https://github.com/decentraland/deployments-to-sqs) to hear new changes of the Content Server network.


1. **Q:** Can we get regular back end updates posted somewhere, so we know what's been updated when, at the exact time it's pushed through?<br/>
**R:** All Catalyst Releases include a [changelog](https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst/releases) and you can hook with Github to listen to every new Catalyst Release. Also, every time a new version of the Catalyst is released and deployed it’s announced at [Catalyst Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/417796904760639509/948230185457696820). Anyway, the rollout depends on the Catalyst Owners, each of them has the responsibility of updating their catalyst version.


1. **Q:** Do you have any plans either now or in the future to expand the current isla<nd/realm player limitation from 100 to say 1000 or more?<br/>
**R:** The current focus is on making the communications among 100 users more efficient, improving the latency and throughput. In that line, we are working on [Comms V3](https://rfc.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-70) which includes adding new transports such as Livekit and Websocket Room Service. Also, we are working on improving the performance of P2P and running [different approaches](https://rfc.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-114) and comparing them.
Anyway, there’s a visual limitation about rendering avatars in the UI, for example: having 1000 users in a few parcels could overload the visualization and make it impossible to have a good in-world experience.

1. **Q:** Are there any plans to allow a federation of Decentralands, in a similar way Mastodon/Fediverse works? Where anyone can spawn its own instance?<br/> 
**R:** In the current infrastructure, the DAO catalyst network is distributed: this means that each server stores all the data, validates everything and broadcasts changes. If anyone wants to run their own server that listens to the changes from the DAO servers, they can. In the same line, if anyone wants to run their instance or a fork they can.

1. **Q:** By running my own catalysts, I likely have a "private" , full feature DCL haven't I ? Only person who knows the URL can join that private DCL?<br/>
**R:** If you are running your private catalyst with the default configuration (that includes Content Server, Lambdas Server and Comms), then it is accessible to anyone who has the link to it. Anyway, any change done there won’t be replicated to the PROD environment as it’s not part of the DAO Catalysts.
If you want to Run a fork of Decentraland then you Can read the blog post about running your own Catalyst [ignoring blockchain validations](https://docs.decentraland.org/contributor/tutorials/how-to-run-a-catalyst/#using-your-node-for-scene-development).

1. **Q:** How can we view the files (especially the glb files) uploaded to the content server?<br/>
**R:** Use the API: https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/
Get the latest entity for the parcel: https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Content-Server/operation/getListOfEntities
Download the files referenced there: https://decentraland.github.io/catalyst-api-specs/#tag/Content-Server/operation/getContentFile

1. **Q:** How much disk space is currently required to run a catalyst locally? Do you have any plans to reduce that number in the future?<br/>
**R:** Light node (garbage collection on, removes the content history): 700GB  // Full node (keeps the content history on disk): 1.35TB

1. **Q:** Which are the main Github repositories related to "catalyst and decentralized services" and what are their for?<br/>
**R:** 
   - Architecture: https://github.com/decentraland/architecture
   - Platform: 
     https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst
     https://github.com/decentraland/catalyst-owner
   - Dservices:
     https://github.com/decentraland/matrix-playbook
     https://github.com/decentraland/social-service/
     https://github.com/decentraland/dcl-quests


1. **Q:** Are you considering donating land for your verified partners to better promote themselves? Thus, when decentraland users come to a certain area, they can enter the stores of verified partners and experience what kind of service they can get.<br/>
**R:** The best way to get the LAND for the project would be to ask for it through a DAO poll and if the community supports the project, the DAO would probably be able to get the needed resources. 

1. **Q:** Currently 3D models are optimized by Catalysts servers. Why is done there, and not by the CLI as a "import" stage? That could give more control to creators<br/>
**R:** The optimizations of the 3D models require the use of a payed API key, this is the main reason why they are run in a service and the consumed by the client instead of being run locally with the CLI. 

1. **Q:** How can I, as an educator, assist the developers in communicating those better tools for pipeline optimization<br/>
**R:** Creating all sort of documentation assets, blog posts, tutorials and engaging with questions in Discord trying to provide answers and help content creators.  

1. **Q:** Where are Catalysts servers located?<br/>

1. **Q:** Are there any plans to create a solution that allows to deploy scenes and share with others without owning a land? Heroku wont be free from Nov 28<br/>
**R:** Yes, please check out the Worlds [ADR-111](https://rfc.decentraland.org/adr/ADR-111)


1. **Q:**  There was a recent proposal on uploading PFP images to DCL names, are there any plans or updates for this feature to be implemented on DCL's marketplace?<br/>
**R:** There was no plan for this but it will be considered now. 

1. **Q:** Is it possible to make an object fly across many parcels, on a certain altitude?<br/>
**R:** 

1. **Q:** Is there an API where we can get the infos about all the users who participate in an event? We know about the EVENTS API  but we can only see the last 10 :(<br/>
**R:** 

1. **Q:**  What are DCL's plans in regards to renting land? As there are available solutions, will DCL continue to build their own or think about a potential partnership?<br/>
**R:** 


1. **Q:** Is there any plans to add an in-world Name swap feature - similar to how users can change their Wearables + Emotes in their Backpack?<br/>
**R:**

1. **Q:**   With regards to the scene creation, sometimes when completing the scene in the builder, it loses certain parts of the built. Will it be optimized in the future?<br/>
**R:**

1. **Q:** What is the biggest technically limiting factor in improving performance of dcl, is it the specs of the catalyst nodes or more of a program architecture issue?<br/>
**R:** 


1. **Q:** I am unable to add POAPs to decentraland, each ID i supply is rejected. Is there an issue /w this service?<br/> 
**R:**  


1. **Q:** Any plans to make bug reporting easier? 2 Major problems I see : a) users dont know how to debug b) github isn't a friendly platform to communicate/follow-up<br/>
**R:**
